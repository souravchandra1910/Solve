# üîô Backtracking

Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve constraint satisfaction problems, combinatorial problems, and optimization problems. It systematically explores all possible solutions and abandons paths that cannot yield valid results.

## üöÄ Introduction
Backtracking is a **brute-force** search technique that incrementally builds a solution while ensuring that constraints are met. If a certain path is invalid, it **backtracks** by undoing the last decision and explores another path.

It is commonly used in:
- **Combinatorial Generation** (Permutations, Combinations, Subsets)
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems** (Sudoku, N-Queens)
- **Graph Problems** (Hamiltonian Cycle, Coloring)
- **Optimization Problems** (Traveling Salesman Problem)

## üîÑ How Backtracking Works
1. **Choose** ‚Äì Select a candidate for the solution.
2. **Explore** ‚Äì Proceed with the choice and recursively solve the problem.
3. **Backtrack** ‚Äì If the current choice is invalid, undo the last step and try another option.

## üìù General Backtracking Template
```
function BACKTRACK(path, options):
    if is_solution(path):
        process_solution(path)
        return
    
    for each option in options:
        if is_valid(option, path):
            path.append(option)  // Make a choice
            BACKTRACK(path, new_options)  // Explore further
            path.pop()  // Undo the choice (backtrack)

```
