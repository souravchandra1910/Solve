## 🚀 Introduction
DSA consists of two fundamental concepts:
1. **Data Structures** – Organizing and storing data efficiently.
2. **Algorithms** – Step-by-step procedures to manipulate data and solve problems.

Understanding DSA allows programmers to optimize their code in terms of time and space complexity.

## 📂 Data Structures
Data Structures are ways to store and organize data efficiently.

### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
1. **Array** – Static data structure with a fixed size.
2. **Linked List** – A dynamic list where elements are linked via pointers.
3. **Stack** – Follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
4. **Queue** – Follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
5. **Deque** – A double-ended queue allowing insertion/removal from both ends.

### 🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures
1. **Tree** – Hierarchical structure (Binary Tree, BST, AVL Tree, etc.).
2. **Graph** – Collection of nodes (vertices) and edges, used for networks.
3. **Heap** – Specialized tree-based structure (Min Heap, Max Heap).
4. **Hash Table** – Key-value store with efficient lookups.
